## Description

üìö This repository contains the code for a fantastic Streamlit app that allows users to create interactive applications using open-source Hugging Face models without the need to deploy the models to a server. By leveraging the Hugging Face Space-based Inference API, users can easily explore and utilize powerful language models for various tasks.

## Features

‚ú® Interactive Streamlit app: Create engaging and interactive applications using open-source Hugging Face models within a Streamlit interface.

ü§ó Hugging Face integration: Leverage the wide range of pre-trained models available on the Hugging Face Model Hub for various NLP tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.

‚ö°Ô∏è Quick prototyping: Develop and iterate on your ideas rapidly by utilizing pre-trained models and the simplicity of Streamlit.

üåê No server deployment required: With the Hugging Face Space-based Inference API, there's no need to set up and maintain your own server. The app connects directly to the Hugging Face API, saving time and resources.
